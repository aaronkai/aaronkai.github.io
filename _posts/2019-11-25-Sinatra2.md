# Hanging Sinatra

The Ruby module of Odin Project included a hangman game, written in Ruby, and played on the console. The goal of the current project is to port it over into Sinatra. I've about finished the backend routes and controllers. 

I looked around today at where to host the app. Considered trying to learn to containerize the app and host it in the cloud, but I honestly don't want to maintain an AWS or GCS account. Instead, I'm dusting off my Heroku account. The app is live there now.

Finally, I'm working on the styles for the page. I'm going to use Flexbox for responsive design. I'm trying out BEM as a CSS framework. It's definately not the way I was taught, but I think I can get used to it.
