# Still Hanging Sinatra

Ah yes, a day spent doing nothing but looking up CSS selectors on the internet. Such fun. 

Got a hangman image from Noun Project and spend a while trying to figure out how to use it as backgroung-image before I decided that wan't the right path, and to use img tag instead. 

Messed around with fonts, colors, etc. Going for a metal theme right now.
