#Summary of efforts to date:
At the recommendation of the guys on the ShopTalk podcast, I am going to try to keep up with my accomplishments and what I’ve learned. 

This journey began with my looking into masters programs in coding because I was frustrated in my current position and couldn’t bear the thought of studying for yet another technical certification in systems administration. I came across the University of Chicago’s web page that said you probably didn’t need a masters if you just want to code. They recommended the Odin Project as a way to teach yourself. I checked it out and decided to start.

I’m now partway through the first module that is an introduction to the building blocks of web development. I remembered a lot of HTML and CSS from my past education, but a lot of the javaScript is new to me. 

I started a CodeAnywhere account.

#5/12-13
Working on Wes Bos Array Cardio exercises

Array.prototype.filter:
Returns new array with all elements that pass given test

Array.prototype.map
Returns new array created by calling provided function on each element of array

Array.prototype.sort
Returns sorted array

Array.prototype.reduce
Returns a single value after executing a reducer function on every element of the array

Array.prototype.some: 
tests whether an element of an array matches a given condition

Array.prototype.every:
 tests whether every element of an array matches a given condition

Array.prototype.find
Array.prototype.findIndex




#5/14/2019
Working on exercises to improve JavaScript skills. Detect a palindrome. 

#5/15
Coded a shift cipher
Coded fibonacci sequence iteratively and trying to understand recursion

#5/16
Worked on reduce function to find oldest person in array of objects. Gave me some headaches. Starting calculator project. 

#5/17
Started working on calculator.js app. Had some fun playing with Flexbox and css. It’s been a while.

#5/18
Started working on the javascript to process event listeners on calc keys. Working on calc logic now.

#5/22
Working on the logic to do math as the user enters it

#5/24
I’ve gone in circles a bit with the logic for this calculator. 

#5/28
My First good day in a while. Got a lot of the logic filled in for making the UI work

#5/29
Almost done with existing logic. Operations, decimal, clear, backspace all work. Need to decide how much work I want to do to get this as finished as possible. 

#6/5
Started the intro to Ruby module. Calculator is done enough. Not sure how much work to put into a project that will probably seem childishly simplistic eventually. 

#6/6
Wrote a pig latin translator

#6/7 
Learned about ruby classes and started learning Rails

#6/10
Working on tutuoral found at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html#i2:-adding-comments

Further questions from this exercise. Rails security overview: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.8/security.html

#6/11
Finished section on form based workflow

#6/12
Finished Rails section. I started the ruby section. Feeling a little bummed. Not sure it’s worth my time to learn ruby/rails when js seems to have taken over everything. 

Took some time to talk to the guys on the Odin Project Dischord server. Sample of 2, but they think JS is a horrible first language to learn and urge to stay the course. I’m going to try to keep hammering it out. 

Also took a look at local job postings, which not surprisingly, are miserable. No entry level jobs, those that are look like scams. Everyone wants you to know everything. Sigh.

#6/13-6/15
Working on CodeAcademy Ruby module

#6/18-6/19
Worked on Ruby coding assignment. Wrote a bubblesort algorithm. 


#6/20-6/25
Working on an Odin assignment to rewrite the functions in the Enumerables module. Started studying OOP in Ruby.

#6/26
Lots of reading. Ruby OOP and Ruby style guide

#6/27
Started OOP Ruby tic-tac-toe.

#7/2
Was too busy with work to do any coding yesterday. This has been a hard project, as Odin project has not done any instruction in OPP design and I’m trying to figure it all out. Made some good progress. They guys in the chat room told me to chill out. 

#7/8 -7/9
Working on Mastermind program, developing familiarity with OOP.

#7/10
Decided I didn’t really understand Mastermind requirements and left project half done. Moving on to serialization.

#7/16
Finished Serialization reading and now working on the lessons for those readings.

#7/17
Finished Serialization exercise/walk-through and now I’m doing a serialized Hangman.

#7/18
Finished game logic and working on save states and serialization now.

#7/23
Finished Hangman app. Starting reading the section on recursion.

#7/24
Tough day. Spent most of it pounding on recursion and merge sort exercise. Still not sure I get it. 

#7/26
Worked more on recursion

#7/29-7/30
Watched videos on data structures, binary sort.

#7/31
Did exercice building a linked list

#8/5 - 8/8 
Sick and lazy

#8/14
Been bummed lately. Feel like I can’t get recursion and I’ve gotten bogged down trying. Spent all day yesterday trying to build a binary search tree with recursion and just couldn’t get it. 

#8/15
Found some good examples online that got me on track. Getting off my pity pot. Finished the binary search exercises. 


#8/16-8/21
Writing Knight’s travels script

#8/22
Finished Knight’s Travels script! Finally got the path instance variable of the knight object to work. Tried to make it the data structure that would hold all previous paths. Getting push to multidimensional array to work in all instances proved more challenging than I anticipated. 

#8/26
Started learning about RSpec

#8/27-29
Wrote tests for Knight MOves script. Making progress OP did not do a great job teaching the material, but I’ve been figuring it out slowly.


#11/5/19
Wow. It’s my birthday and it’s been three months since I wrote in this journal. I’m 37 years old today. My daughter was born 2 months ago on 9/9/19. I guess that’s a good excuse to be lazy coding :) 

I’ve had some trouble getting started back up. (Un)Fortunately, I’ve had some help getting started. 

I’ve been stuck on this Ruby section of Odin for a while. I’m going to finish up the git section this week and then leave it behind me for now. The chess project can wait. I want to get my hands dirty and build some stuff including a personal website. I’ll need to refresh my HTML and CSS. Looking forward to the upcoming lessons got me excited again, so I’m ready to move on and move forward. Tally ho.
